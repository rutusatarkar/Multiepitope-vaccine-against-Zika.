# Multiepitope-vaccine-against-Zika.
Worked on the vaccine development Project for the zika virus strain Mr766. worked on various approaches from epitope prediction to molecular docking.

The Zika Virus has emerged as a significant global health concern, particularly due to its 
association with severe neurological complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barr√© 
syndrome. Given the urgent need for effective intervention strategies, this study aims to 
develop a targeted vaccine leveraging bioinformatics methodologies to identify B- and T-cell 
epitopes within the Zika virus Strain Mr 766 structural proteins. Through comprehensive 
epitope prediction algorithms, novel epitopes were identified and selected based on criteria 
including toxicity, immunogenicity, and antigenicity. These epitopes were then integrated into 
a multiple epitope vaccine construct, incorporating various linker sequences (EAAAK, AAY,
GPGPG) to optimize immunogenicity. Subsequent molecular docking simulations facilitated 
the design of a vaccine structure capable of effectively interacting with its target receptors. The 
vaccine construct was cloned into a pET-28a (+) vector for expression in Escherichia coli using 
SnapGene software. Evaluation of the expressed vaccine demonstrated a robust immune 
response in preclinical studies. Computational tools were employed to analyze the vaccine's 
efficacy against diverse Zika virus strains. The resulting Multi-Epitope Vaccine (MEV) 
emerges as a promising candidate for combating Zika virus infections, offering potential 
benefits in global public health efforts against this pathogen.
